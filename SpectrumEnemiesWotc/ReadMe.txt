A WOTC port of Spectrum: Yellow Enemies and Aegis Division.

Updated scripts as necessary, fixed some texture problems, and tried to normalize some unit names.

Balance of units and items are left as Yzaxtol created them.

I may try and give them some abilities to give them a more distinct feel instead of just slightly different base units.
